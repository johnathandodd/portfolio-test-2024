      <p>A little bit about me: I'm a seasoned Senior Graphic Designer and Art Director, boasting extensive expertise in both digital platforms and traditional print graphic design. With over two decades of commercial experience spanning various industries including fashion, blockchain and cryptocurrencies, corporate finance, automotive, telecoms, and media, I bring a wealth of creative insight to every project.</p>
      <p>My skill set encompasses a wide range of design disciplines, including UX Design, Information Architecture, Creative Thinking & Conceptual Ideation, and Typography, allowing me to deliver innovative and impactful solutions.</p>
      <p>Having collaborated with esteemed clients and agencies such as Esquire, American Express, IBM, British Telecom, and many others, I've honed my craft in diverse environments, both in-house and agency-side.</p>
      <p>In my recent roles, I've served as a Senior Design professional at a leading London agency specialising in legal and financial sectors, and as Creative Lead at a pioneering cryptocurrency/blockchain firm. These positions involved overseeing design teams, shaping creative direction, and orchestrating captivating event designs.</p>
      <p>Currently, I hold the position of Senior Designer and Brand Guardian at an international bank focusing on US bank accounts for non-US citizens. In this role, I'm entrusted with all creative endeavours, from crafting compelling social media content to revamping presentation templates and pioneering the branding efforts for a new fintech division.</p>
